# Taifho game
### 28.4.2023
I've started this process for giving to chatGPT 4 instructions from the old board game Alga Taifho. I couldn't find rules from Google so i needed to start first scanning the rule sheet with my iPhone and using the text regocnation. Then i just gave those to ChatGPT4 and asked that how I could do this with TypeScript and React. This first day I spend about 6 hours to chatting with ChatGPT4 and I've got working "chessboard".

### 29.4.2023
Now I try to put 2 players game pieces on board. It is not easy task for ChatGPT4. It makes mistakes and I am not experienced developer. I understand basic consepts but in this project there is Probs, Typescript and stuff. Every space means mistake. ChatGPT4 makes mistake as human and sometimes he does typescript errors. For Example it forgots to ad type descriptions as humans does and then the system gives errors. I needed to chat so much that the current limit 30 messages/3 hours did hit:) I didn't get my starting positions right for this day.
## 30.5.2023

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
